    "The below code will stand up a RAG using 3 documents containing reports on public transit and safe streets. (feel free to add your own documents!). They're minimally processed and may give messy results, but the kinds of answers from these sources should be more nuanced than what we see in benchmark datasets like HotPotQA\n",
    "\n",
    "The code creates an in-memory vector store. You will need an OpenAI API key with money in the account. Running the whole thing should only cost a few cents. If you prefer another LLM source, Haystack makes this easy--just replace the embedder and generator and the pipeline will still work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the documents are embedded, we can run questions though them. We the generate synthetic questions with an LLM and test them with the metrics we covered in the course.\n",

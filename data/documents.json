    "content": "Introduction and Fast Facts about Transit in 2023 \nPreface: Understanding the Data Collection\nMost transit systems in the U.S. report to the NTD. After Congress required data reporting in 1974, it set up FTA's NTD to \nbe the repository for data about the financial, operating, and asset conditions of American transit systems. The NTD data in \nthis report is the result of a longitudinal, annual survey of these transit systems. \nThe NTD data is also intended to support planning efforts and aid governments and other decision-makers. This allows for \nthe multiyear comparisons and trend analyses that this report will contain. Beyond the basic data mentioned above, this \nreport also contains more detailed data regarding funding sources, inventories of vehicles and maintenance facilities, safety \nevent reports, measures of transit service provided and consumed, and data on transit employees. \nMany trends presented in this report will reflect the last decade in public transportation and will highlight trends before a nd \nduring the COVID-19 public health emergency. Users should take note that certain trends are either exacerbated or \ndiminished by the result of data collection along different transit agency fiscal years, as discussed further in Chapter 3.\nKey Differences among Transit Systems Reporting to the NTD\nThe NTD collects different levels of data based on either the size or the service area of the reporting entity. Most notably,  \nurban transit systems reporting fewer than 30 vehicles (Reduced Reporters) or operating exclusively in rural areas (Rural \nReporters) do not report the following data:\n· Counts and hours of employees\n· Statement of finances and reconciling operating expenses\n· Vehicle maintenance data\n· Energy consumption\n· Transit station counts by size (Rural Reporters)\n· Detailed Safety & Security event reports\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 1: Introduction and Fast Facts about Transit in 2023 | 3\nExhibit 1.1 identifies the number of agencies involve d in providing transit service by FTA Region in accordance with their \nreporter type (Full Reporter, Reduced Reporter, and Rural Reporter ). These types reflect both the size of the system (Full \nvs. Small System) and the operating environment (Urban vs. Rural). The exhibit spotlights a higher concentration of transit \noperators in Regions 4 and 5, whereas Regions 1 and 3 contain a lower concentration of operators. The FTA Regions are \nshown in the map below with stars representing the FTA Regional Offices.\nExhibit 1.1 – National Count of Transit Operators by FTA Region\n\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 1: Introduction and Fast Facts about Transit in 2023 | 4\nFor more information on reporter types, see the most recent NTD Annual Reporting Policy Manual.\nKey Methods of Aggregation in the NTD\nIn 2023, the NTD classified transit according to 18 distinct modes  (see Chapter 4) in two major categories: Rail and Non-\nRail. These modes and categories are used throughout this report. Many statistics are collected by mode, whereas others\n\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 1: Introduction and Fast Facts about Transit in 2023 | 5\nare collected by transit agency systemwide. Some data records, such as revenue vehicle inventory or facility inventory, may \nspan multiple modes, which creates some challenges with aggregation.\nComparing Transit Ridership with Other Forms of Transportation\nAs Exhibit 1.2 demonstrates, public transit supports far more passenger trips annually (defined further in Chapter 11) than \nother transportation modes. FTA encourages readers to consult the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' 2023 Transportation \nStatistics Annual Report1 for further comparisons. It is important to note the transportation modes listed in Exhibit 1.2 have \ndifferent service structures causing both ridership levels and average trip lengths to vary. ",

As discussed further in Chapter 5, an urbanized area is an area with a population of 50,000 or more that is designated \nas such by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. \nExhibit 2.4 – Urban Formula Program Reporting Requirements\nTitle 49 U.S.C. 5307 (c)\n(1) Grant Recipient Requirements —\n(K) in the case of a recipient for an urbanized area with a population of not fewer than 200,000 individuals, as \ndetermined by the Bureau of the Census, will submit an annual report listing projects carried out in the preceding fiscal \nyear under this section for associated transit improvements as defined in section 5302\nRural Transit Programs\nThe §5311 program provides capital, operating, and planning assistance for public transportation that is operated in rural \nareas. A rural area is defined as any place in the U.S. outside of Census-designated urban areas with at least 50,000 \npersons. Funding recipients are State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) which report on behalf of their subrecipients. \nA subrecipient is a State or local government authority, nonprofit organization, or operator of rural public transportation o r \nintercity bus service that receives §5311 funding through a State DOT. This report will include rural transit funding \nsubrecipients providing public transportation in exhibits along with urban transit operators where possible and unless \notherwise noted. FTA considers Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands as States for rural \ndata collection and funding.

Transit agencies that receive Chapter 53 funds and own capital assets that are \nused for public transportation services are required to report asset information to the NTD, even if the agency does not \nmanage or operate those assets. This requirement applies to all public transportation services funded through any FTA \nprogram. Unlike the preceding requirements, it is not limited to the §5307 urbanized area formula program and the §5311 \nrural area formula program.\nSome agencies affected by the rule are only required to report TAM-related data to the NTD. As the rule does not mandate \nreporting information about service area, FTA has established two unique reporter types for these agencies to collect only \nasset inventory, condition, and performance data .

The Secretary also shall assess future needs for those facilities and \nestimate future capital requirements and operation and maintenance requirements for one-year, 5-year, and 10-year \nperiods at specified levels of service.\nHuman Services Transportation\nFTA’s §5310 program for enhanced mobility of seniors and individuals with disabilities has four eligible purposes according \nto 49 U.S.C. 5310 (b)(1):\n(A) Public transportation projects…to meet the needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities when public \ntransportation is insufficient, inappropriate, or unavailable;\n(B) Public transportation projects that exceed the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n(C) Public transportation projects that improve access to fixed-route service and decrease reliance by individuals with \ndisabilities on complementary paratransit; and\n(D) Alternatives to public transportation that assist seniors and individuals with disabilities with transportation.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act  of 1990 (ADA) requires most providers of public transportation to provide paratransit \nservices to individuals with disabilities who  do not use  the fixed-route system. These paratransit services are defined as \npublic transportation because they are limited to a segment of the public defined by disability. The §5310 program provides \nfunding to go beyond those requirements, including by providing service to a segment of the public defined by age. \n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 2: Overview of Public Transportation and Reporting Requirements | 21\nThe fourth purpose, alternatives to public transportation, is unique to the §5310 program. Subrecipients of the §5310 \nprogram for alternatives to public transportation do not have NTD reporting requirements and do not report these services \nto the NTD. These alternatives to public transportation can take several forms. For example, the provider could fund a client-\nspecific transportation service that reduces the need for ADA-eligible persons to request paratransit trips or they could fund \na “Meals on Wheels” program to reduce the distance traveled to access a service.\nIn addition to FTA, there are nine other Federal agencies with 130 programs that may fund human services transportation \nfor older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals. Most of these programs are not public transportation \nbecause they are limited to clients of a specific program, service, or facility and are not open to a general segment of the \npublic defined by age, disability, or low income. As such, these services are not included in the NTD, and by extension, are \nnot included in this report. Nevertheless, by providing transportation services to these populations, they help reduce the \ndemand for trips that might otherwise be provided by public transportation. The Secretary of Transportation chairs the \nFederal Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility to break down barriers between these programs and promote \naccessible, efficient, and effective transportation for disadvantaged populations.   \nThe National Center for Mobility Management, a national technical assistance center, collects and publishes a full inventory \nof 1,53810 identified human service transportation operators in the Community Transportation Database, which is funded \nthrough the §5310 program.\n10 National Center for Mobility Management, Community Transportation Database, Accessed August 2024.\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 3: Overview of Transit Agency Organizations | 22\nChapter 3. Overview of Transit Agency Organizations \nThis chapter discusses the general data collection principles of the NTD and provides basic definitions to stratify the types \nof agencies filing NTD reports.\nTransit Agency Fiscal Year Cohorts\nNTD data, for the most part, represents annual data collected during the fiscal year of the agency. As such, agencies are \ngrouped into three reporting groups representing the month in which their annual NTD report is due for submission: October \nreporters, January reporters, and April reporters. The assigned reporting group determines an agency’s Annual Report due \ndate, the last day to submit revisions of the report, as well as the report closeout date. NTD Annual Reports are generally \ndue four months after the end of each agency’s fiscal year.\nAs demonstrated in Exhibit 3.1, 53 percent of all transit agencies  operate on a July to June fiscal year, 18 percent follow \nthe Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) of October to September, and 28 percent follow a calendar year fiscal year. \nHowever, the count of agencies in each cohort is not proportional to the share of the national total statistics in this report. \nFor example, the July–June cohort accounts for just under half (4 6 percent) of all operating expenses. The calendar year \ncohort accounts for 44  percent of all operating expenses  since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York is \nincluded in that group. The FFY cohort accounts for only 9 percent of total operating expenses.\nExhibit 3.1 – 2023 Count of Transit Agency Fiscal Year Cohorts\nFiscal Year \nEnd Reporter Count Percent of Total \nReporters\nPercent of Total \nOperating Expenses\nJanuary 0 0.0% 0.0%\nFebruary 1 0.03% 0.1%\nMarch 4 0.1% 0.8%\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 3: Overview of Transit Agency Organizations | 23\nFiscal Year \nEnd Reporter Count Percent of Total \nReporters\nPercent of Total \nOperating Expenses\nApril 3 0.1% 0.1%\nMay 0 0.0% 0.0%\nJune 1,768 52.5% 46.4%\nJuly 0 0.0% 0.0%\nAugust 58 1.7% 0.2%\nSeptember 590 17.5% 8.5%\nOctober 7 0.2% 0.1%\nNovember 0 0.0% 0.0%\nDecember 934 27.8% 44.0%\nTotal 3,365 100.0% 100.0%\nNTD Organization Types\nTransit providers report their organization type in the NTD Annual Report.

A transit authority is the type of organization that may come to mind when someone thinks of a \ntransit agency; however, as shown in Exhibit 3.3, transit authorities make up only about 16 percent of transit providers. In \ncontrast, nearly half of all transit operators in the NTD are departments located within a city or county government. Private \nOperators, including private nonprofits, for-profit corporations, and private providers reporting on behalf of a public agency \naccounted for 25 percent of all reporters. The Other category is comprised of organization types like Area Agencies on \nAging, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Tribes, and Universities. \n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 3: Overview of Transit Agency Organizations | 25\nExhibit 3.3 – 2023 NTD Reporters by Organization Type\nNational Total of 2,799 NTD IDs\n\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 4: Overview of Transit Operations | 26\nChapter 4. Overview of Transit Operations \nTransit Modes\nA public transit mode is a system for carrying transit passengers described by specific right-of-way (ROW), technology, and \noperational features. A variety of modes are operated in the U.S. Most data collected by the NTD is reported by transit \nagencies according to the modes they operate, as defined in Exhibit 4.1. For the purpose of this report, modes with similar \ncharacteristics have been grouped under “Consolidated Modes” to show transit trends more clearly while allowing for easier \ncomparisons across different service types at a broader level:\n· Core Rail consists of Rail modes that travel relatively short distances. This consolidated mode includes Heavy Rail \n(HR), Light Rail (LR), Streetcar Rail (SR), Cable Car (CC), Inclined Plane (IP), Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG), \nand Aerial Tramway (TR). \n· Distance Rail consists of Rail modes that travel longer distances between stops, often connecting suburban or rural \nareas to an urban center. This consolidated mode includes Commuter Rail (CR), Hybrid Rail (YR), and Alaska \nRailroad (AR).\n· Fixed-Route Bus consists of Non-Rail modes with set routes including Bus (MB), Bus Rapid Transit (RB), Trolleybus \n(TB), Commuter Bus (CB), and Público (PB).\nThe remaining modes, Ferryboat (FB), Vanpool (VP), and Demand Response (DR) are included in the Other Non-Rail \nconsolidated mode. \nExhibit 4.1 – NTD Transit Mode Definitions\nRail Modes\nAlaska Railroad (AR) – A public transportation system in Alaska that shares vehicles and \nfacilities with freight Rail operations.\n2023 National Transit Summaries & Trends\nChapter 4: Overview of Transit Operations | 27\nRail Modes\nCable Car (CC) – A type of railway propelled by moving cables located beneath the street. \nCurrently, the only operational system is in San Francisco.\nCommuter Rail (CR) – An electric- or diesel-propelled railway for urban passenger train service \nconsisting of local travel that operates between a central city and outlying areas. Service must be \noperated on a regular basis by or under contract with a transit operator for transporting \npassengers within urbanized areas or between urbanized areas and outlying areas. This mode is \ngenerally characterized by multi-trip tickets, specific station-to-station fares, railroad employment \npractices, relatively long distances between stops, and only one to two stations in the central \nBusiness district. Note: intercity rail service, such as Amtrak, is excluded from the CR mode.\nHeavy Rail (HR) – An electric railway that operates service in exclusive ROW. The service is \noften provided by long trains of six to eight cars or more that travel relatively short distances \nbetween stops within a city and the immediate suburbs. The Nation's traditional subway systems \nare classified as Heavy Rail.\n",

All \nrail, catenary, and ferryboat systems operate over FG. Bus lanes must be dedicated to transit according to certain rules to \nbe considered FG. Lanes that allow taxis or commercial vehicles are not considered dedicated to transit and, therefore, are \nnot considered FG. The NTD collects Directional Route Miles (DRM), the total miles in each direction on a public \ntransportation route over FG or HIB.\nOnly one transit agency, mode, and Type of Service (TOS), may claim the DRM for a segment of FG/HIB, even if multiple \nagencies operate along the segment. This “claiming” approach is used to ensure that the DRM for the segment is only used \nonce in FTA apportionment of funds to a UZA. Agencies then allocate the Fixed Guideway Directional Route Miles (FG \nDRM) from their claimed segments to the UZAs that they serve according to NTD Serve Rules. Fixed guideway service is \nhighly concentrated. The Largest 8 UZAs (New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington D.C., \nLos Angeles, and Seattle) alone account for 53 percent (7,967.4 miles) of the Nation’s fixed guideway.

Core Rail mileage \nhas increased by 12 percent and Distance Rail mileage has increased by 4.1 percent. Fixed-Route Bus Guideway has \nshown the largest increase, with a 44 percent increase in mileage. This reflects the introduction of several new Bus Rapid \nTransit (BRT) systems, as well as exclusive bus lanes for some other bus systems that did not fully qualify as BRT systems. \nFerry mileage also increased by 35 percent, although this was largely driven by existing ferry systems reporting to the NTD \nfor the first time, rather than the introduction of new ferry services.\nIn 2023, 61.4 percent of the total Fixed Guideway DRM was reported under the Distance Rail consolidated mode.
